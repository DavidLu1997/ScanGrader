# ScanGrader
An Optical Mark Recognition Program

ScanGrader is intended to simplify test/quiz marking for schools, being an open-source alternative for scantron.

Accuracy on a standard 50 question scan sheet approaches 100% for scanner-based deployments, and 80% using a mobile camera. Extensive calibrations are being conducted to ensure accuracy.

This is currently being developed for Windows x86.
In the future, we plan on deploying it to iOS, Windows UWP, and OS X.
