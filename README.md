# ZopperScanAPI
An Optical Mark Recognition API

ZopperScan is intended to simplify test/quiz marking for schools, being an open-source alternative for scantron.

Accuracy on a standard 50 question scan sheet approaches 100% for scanner-based deployments, and 80% using a mobile camera. Extensive calibrations are being conducted to ensure accuracy.

This is currently being developed for two platforms , Windows x86 in this repository, and Android in another.
In the future, we plan on deploying it to iOS, Windows UWP, and OS X.
